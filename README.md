Minecraft is the best-selling video game of all time, built in Java. Skript is a plugin that "allows you to customize Minecraft's mechanics with simple scripts written in plain English sentences". Between 2012 and 2015, I coded many skripts to streamline the process behind running my server, and to customise the games I could play on it.
