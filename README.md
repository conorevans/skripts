Minecraft is the best-selling video game of all time, built in Java. Skript is a plugin that "allows you to customize Minecraft's mechanics with simple scripts written in plain English sentences". Between 2012 and 2015, I coded many skripts to streamline the process behind running my server, and to customise the games I could play on it. Unfortunately, 15-year-old me did not really consider 20-year-old portfolio-creating me and deleted his Reddit account, on which all of the skripts were posted, and recycled the laptop on which they were coded. As such, the repository is a bit bare, as I attempt to scour old e-mail addresses and old haunts for the programs. However, it gives a brief insight into what first inspired me to code, and without the experience I would likely not have chosen Computer Science as a university degree.
